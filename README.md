This project is a responsive website template designed for a camping theme, built using HTML and CSS. The development process involved the following steps:

- Initially, I created a styles folder containing separate CSS files: **fonts.css**, **app.css**, **grid.css**, **reset.css**, and **responsive.css** to organize the styling efficiently.
- As the project progressed, I consolidated all these files into a single **app.css** file to optimize server requests and reduce load times, ensuring a smoother user experience.

This template is optimized for all devices, making it fully responsive with a clean and professional design.
